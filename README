Here are some examples of my [anim_framework](https://github.com/ldo/anim_framework)
Python library in action. They all work by generating the frames as sequentially-numbered
PNG files into a subdirectory called “frames”. Use the “run” wrapper script to run
them; this will take care of (re)creating this subdirectory, and ensuring it does
not contain any leftover output from a previous script run. It will also play back
the result, using ffplay.
